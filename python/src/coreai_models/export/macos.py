"""
macOS model export pipeline.

Exports a PyTorch LLM model to a Core AI AIProgram via:
torch.export -> decompose -> defunctionalize -> TorchConverter -> optimize.

The result carries one entrypoint, ``main``, or two when the model opts into
``exports_prefill_graph``: ``main`` for decode, ``prefill`` for the prompt. An eager
module is traced twice for that -- the second time with prefill mode on, so it returns
nothing and the LM head drops out. A flattened graph module has no prefill mode left to
set, so the one trace is staged twice instead, the second time with its non-state
outputs trimmed off, which leaves the LM head dead.
